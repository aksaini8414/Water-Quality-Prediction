# Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict water quality parameters based on environmental factors. It aims to provide accurate forecasts for parameters such as pH level, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc., using datasets sourced from reputable sources like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or local government agencies.

## Features
- Predicts water quality parameters based on environmental variables.
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- Provides an interactive web application for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
- The project uses publicly available water quality datasets from sources like EPA or WHO.
- Includes features such as temperature, precipitation, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, etc.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and correlations.
- Feature Engineering to extract relevant features and create new ones if necessary.
- Model Selection and Training using various machine learning algorithms.
- Model Evaluation to assess the performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deployment of the trained model using Flask or Django for real-time predictions.
